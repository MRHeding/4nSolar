## What's Been Added

I've added the "Under Review" status to your quotations system! Here's what's new:

### âœ… **Frontend Changes (Already Done)**
- Added "Under Review" option to custom status dropdown
- Added purple badge styling for under review status
- Added "Mark Under Review" quick action buttons
- Updated status display to show "Under Review" (formatted properly)

### ðŸ”§ **Database Setup Required**

To complete the setup, you need to update your database to include the new status option:

#### **Option 1: Run the Setup Script (Recommended)**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost/4nsolarSystem/add_under_review_status.php`
3. The script will automatically add the status to your database

#### **Option 2: Manual SQL (If you prefer)**
Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin or your MySQL client:
```sql
ALTER TABLE quotations MODIFY COLUMN status 
ENUM('draft','sent','under_review','accepted','rejected','expired') 
DEFAULT 'draft';
```
